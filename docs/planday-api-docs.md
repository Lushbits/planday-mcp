# Planday API Documentation - Complete Reference

## Getting Started

### Overview

Welcome to Planday! This API documentation will help you build powerful integrations to Planday using our REST API. Here's how to get started:

#### 1. Get Started with Planday
- **Request a demo portal** for development and testing by filling out [this form](https://forms.gle/D8eASsTeJGKCoNYd7)

#### 2. Learn About API Basics
- **Authentication**: Access is secured by standard OAuth2 flow with bearer token
- **Data Format**: All request and response data must be in JSON format
- **API Structure**: Separated into several domains (HR, Absence, etc.)
- **Pagination**: Most endpoints return max 50 records per page with offset handling
- **Postman Collection**: Request it by emailing [apisupport@planday.com](mailto:apisupport@planday.com)

#### 3. Set Up Your Test App
- Navigate to Settings â†’ API access in your portal
- Use "Create app" button to create development application
- Choose appropriate scopes (cannot be added later, so choose all if unsure)
- Authorize the app on the portal
- Use the [Set Up Your Business guide](https://help.planday.com/en/articles/3702459-getting-started-set-up-your-business) to customize your portal

## Authorization

### OAuth2 Protocol
Planday API uses standard OAuth2 protocol with Authorization Code flow. You need to:
1. Create an API application in Planday
2. Authorize the application for each portal where integration will access data

### Authorization Flow Types

#### For Customers (Direct Integration)
Use this approach when customers will connect your integration manually via Planday Settings.

**Step 1: Create Application**
- Navigate to Settings > Integrations > API Access (Administrator access required)
- Click "Create app" and configure settings
- Note down Client ID

**Step 2: Authorize Application**
- Select "Authorize" next to your application
- Review consent screen carefully
- Confirm access to all listed resources
- Click "Authorize"

**Step 3: Get Access Credentials**
You'll need:
- **Client ID**: From your application settings
- **Refresh Token**: Generated after authorization

#### For Product Partners
Use this approach for integrations available to multiple mutual customers.

**Prerequisites:**
- Contact [apisupport@planday.com](mailto:apisupport@planday.com) for demo account access
- Create application in demo portal following same steps as customers
- Implement authorization code flow for customer portals

### Authorization Code Flow

#### Step 1: Redirect User to Authorization URL
```
https://id.planday.com/connect/authorize?client_id={clientId}&response_type=code&redirect_uri={redirectUri}&scope={scopes}&state={state}
```

**Parameters:**
- `client_id` [Required]: Your APP ID from API Access page
- `redirect_uri` [Required]: URL-encoded redirect URL (up to 3 URLs allowed)
- `response_type` [Required]: Must be "code"
- `scope` [Required]: Space-separated list including "openid offline_access" plus your API scopes
- `state` [Optional]: Unique value for CSRF protection

**Example:**
```bash
curl --location --request GET 'https://id.planday.com/connect/authorize?client_id=f2370889-3ffe-46b6-83e7-1a20f5a20d2f&scope=openid%20offline_access%20employee:read&redirect_uri=http://example.com/code&response_type=code&state=xyzABC123'
```

#### Step 2: Handle Redirect Response
After user authorization, Planday redirects to your URL with:
```
{redirectURL}?code={code}&state={state}
```

#### Step 3: Exchange Code for Tokens
**Request:**
```
POST https://id.planday.com/connect/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id={applicationId}&grant_type=authorization_code&code={code}&redirect_uri=https://myapp.com/redirect
```

**Response:**
```json
{
  "id_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjgyQjU1OEI2NDA3QTkwRTlCRjIzMzYyQUM2M0E3NTdDMjNFQ0FC",
  "access_token": "eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImtpZCI6IjgyQjU1OEI2NDA3QTkwRTlCRjIzMzYyQUM2M0E3NTdDMjNFQ0FCM",
  "expires_in": 3600,
  "token_type": "Bearer",
  "refresh_token": "VxLtcy_OWkWoPKqs4uFhTg",
  "scope": "openid shift:read offline_access"
}
```

### Getting Access Tokens

#### Exchange Refresh Token for Access Token
```bash
curl -X POST \
--data "client_id=CLIENT_ID&grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=TOKEN" \
https://id.planday.com/connect/token
```

#### Making API Requests
Every API request must include these headers:
```
X-ClientId: CLIENT_ID
Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN
```

**Example API Call:**
```bash
curl -X GET \
-H "Authorization: Bearer ACCESS_TOKEN" \
-H "X-ClientId: CLIENT_ID" \
https://openapi.planday.com/hr/v1/Departments
```

### Token Revocation
To disconnect/revoke access:
```
POST https://id.planday.com/connect/revocation
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

client_id={yourAppId}&token={refreshToken}
```

## Rate Limiting

### Rate Limit Rules
| Limit Bucket | Per Portal Limit | Per Client-ID Limit |
|--------------|------------------|---------------------|
| Per Second   | 20 requests      | 100 requests        |
| Per Minute   | 750 requests     | 2000 requests       |

- Exceeding limits results in HTTP 429 response
- Do not retry until rate limit counter resets
- Each request counts against both portal and client-id limits

### Rate Limit Headers
| HTTP Header | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| `x-ratelimit-reset` | Seconds until counter resets |
| `x-ratelimit-remaining` | Remaining requests in current window |
| `x-ratelimit-limit` | Current limit quotas |

### Examples

**Normal Request (within limits):**
```bash
$ curl -v 'https://openapi.planday.com/hr/v1/Departments' -H "Authorization: Bearer $token"
< HTTP/2 200
< x-ratelimit-limit: 100, 20;w=1, 750;w=60, 100;w=1, 2000;w=60
< x-ratelimit-remaining: 99
< x-ratelimit-reset: 1
```

**Rate Limited Request:**
```bash
$ curl -v 'https://openapi.planday.com/hr/v1/Departments' -H "Authorization: Bearer $token"
< HTTP/2 429
< x-ratelimit-limit: 2000, 20;w=1, 750;w=60, 100;w=1, 2000;w=60
< x-ratelimit-remaining: 0
< x-ratelimit-reset: 33
```
