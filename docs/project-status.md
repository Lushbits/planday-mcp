## 🔮 Roadmap & Next Steps

### Phase 1: Time & Attendance (High Priority)
```typescript
// Missing capabilities
get-timeclock-entries      // Real-time clock in/out status
create-timeclock-entry     // Clock employees in/out
approve-timeclock-entries  // Approve time entries
get-attendance-summary     // Daily/weekly attendance overview
```

### Phase 2: Shift Management Operations
```typescript
// CRUD operations for shifts
create-shift              // Create new shifts
update-shift             // Modify existing shifts
delete-shift             // Remove shifts
assign-employee-to-shift // Staff open shifts
get-open-shifts         // Available shifts needing coverage
```

### Phase 3: Advanced Analytics
```typescript
// Business intelligence features
get-labor-cost-analysis    // Cost optimization insights
get-schedule-efficiency   // Coverage vs demand analysis
get-employee-performance  // Productivity metrics
generate-custom-reports   // Flexible reporting engine
```

### Phase 4: Employee Lifecycle
```typescript
// Full HR management
create-employee          // Onboard new employees
update-employee         // Update employee details
get-employee-skills     // Skills and certifications
update-pay-rates        // Compensation management
```
